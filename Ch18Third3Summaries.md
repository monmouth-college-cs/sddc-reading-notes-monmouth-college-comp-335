#Ethical Discussion and Decision Making

One possible method of making an ethical decision involves identifying and describing the problem and then analyzing the problem and coming to a conclusion. The contents of each part can be changed to fit your situation and goals, but there are some recommended actions/questions.

#Identifying and Describing the Problem

Recommended actions: 

1. Writing down the ethical problem to get a clear understanding of it

2. Listing the risks, problems, and possible consequences

3. Making a list of everyone involved in or affected by the decision to be made

4. Identify all the basic ethical issues in each case and try to understand the rights and wrongs of the situation and what ethical rules might be involved

5. Identify any legal issues, such as intellectual property issues or health and safety issues

6. List possible actions if the problem is more complex than a simple yes or no

#Analyzing the Problem

Recommended actions/questions:

1. What does your moral intuition say about these issues?

2. Identify the responsibilities of the decision maker.

3. Identify the rights of the stakeholders (those involved or affected by the issue).

4. Consider the consequences of each choice on the stakeholders.

5. Find the sections of the SE Code and the ACM code related to the problem and the choices.

6. Consider the deontological and utilitarian approaches to the problem.

7. List, and if necessary prioritize, each course of action that the ethical theories point to.

8. Make the choice that seems best.

9. If multiple choices seem acceptable, pick one and reflect on your decision.

#Case Studies

Here are four case studies depicting running into ethical problems involving intellectual property, privacy issues, system safety issues, and conflicts of interest, respectively:

1. A poor school was gifted a bunch of computers, and half of them will be used to help students struggling with math. There's a program that would really help with that, and the school has one copy of it, but there's not enough money to buy more copies. Should the school illegally copy the program to all the computers?

2. A developer is out sick, and another developer asks the project manager to copy all the files from the sick developer's computer to his computer so he can work. What should the manager do?

3. A program is being made that will control a radiation-dispensing device meant to destroy cancerous tumors. The project manager wants to release the program after the routine testing but before the scheduled stress testing to meet a deadline. Is that okay?

4. A software consultant is asked to decide which of a set of companies should be given a bunch of money to make a city's new administrative computing system. The consultant's spouse works for one of the companies, and the consultant has seen and strongly approved of their spouse's proposal for the new system. How much about this should the consutant tell the city?

#The Last Word on Ethics?

Fundamental ethical principles you should remember and follow:

1. Be impartial: Be loyal to society and yourself as well as your company.

2. Disclose information that others ought to have: Don't decieve, mislead, or hide information, including conflicts of interest, from those who need to know it.

3. Respect the rights of others: Don't steal intellectual property, misuse others property, or violate civil rights.

4. Treat others justly: Don't discriminate against others for attributes unrelated to their job.

5. Take responsibility for your own actions and inactions.

6. Take responsibility for the actions of those you supervise: Includes communicating effectively with your employees.

7. Maintain your integrity: Deliver on your commitments. Be loyal to (ethical) employers. Don't ask someone to do anything you wouldn't do yourself.

8. Continually improve your abilities.

9. Share your knowledge, expertise, and values: You're obligated to share what you've learned from experience and to set an example.
