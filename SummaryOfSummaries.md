### Summary ###
Chapter 3 is titled "Project Management Essentials" because it dicusses exactly what the title implies. Project management skills are important because if you are working on a project that is larger than a 'small project' and/or have more than one developer communication and organization can be cruicial to a project success or failure. Through many aspects of project planning, organization, estimates, and schedules a project can be managed in defferent ways. To me, the most important aspect of project management is velocity. Velocity is where you take the initially estimated time and divide it by the actual time the project took. This allows developers to analyze and improve on their efforts, schedules, and overall efficiancy by checking to see how accurate their estimates were. This can lead to the improvement of project estimates, or overall working process(whichever was more likely to cause the project to be late). It is important to stay on schedule because if there is any slippage it can cause the team to cut out important features or increase the amount of defects.
