## SummaryofSummaries

	Requirements are a list of features  what a program is supposed to do which are really funcitonal requirements. They sould be categorized, prioritized and examined. Four different types of requirements are
1. User requirements - the details of expectations of the users of the program. 
2. Domain requirements - the heart of the application because they need to be match the lastest version of system.
3. Non-functional requirements - the services and features of the program which effect user epxerience.
4. Non-requirements - the things that are not going be included and make sure the project owner knows about it.
		To gather requirements for Plan-driven model, there are two types specs,functional spec and technical spec should be written down before doing actual coding work. Outline of funcitonal sepc should start with overview of the program followed by disclaimer,claiming for missing specs, and end with author's name. Wirting scenarios can make customers read them and get feedback from them. If there is unclear about the requriement, make an issue and put under open issues section. Writing all the requirements on a notebook can help from forgetting. Gathering user stories for Agile model include 3 parts Cards, outilnes of stories, Conversations, discussion between customer and developer, and Confirmation. The requierments are then divided into sepreate tasks. They need to be specific and indepedent of each other, small and doable in a good time estimation.
