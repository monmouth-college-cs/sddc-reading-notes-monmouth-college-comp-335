#### Deontological Theories (p 284-285)
 Deontologists believe people's acitons should be guided by the moral laws and they need to be universal which can apply in any matter. The arguments focus on the intent of an act and how that act is or is not defensible as an application of a moral law which do not concern with consequences of an act.
 The fundamental ideas of deontological theory that Kant contributed are - the ethical rules must be universal which could be appply for any cases, the law should respect rational human beings and they are logically correct or reasonably accpected.
 Adavantages of deontological ethics are that - they are rational which means they can be explained logically, they are morally universal judgments, and there is no discrimination.
 Disatvantages are that the rules are so universal that they can get conflicted and the deintological arguments can not reslove the conflict and they do much concern about the consequences.
