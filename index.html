<h2>Summary</h2>
chapter 1 was a short chapter and it talk about the best way to develop software , you need to understand how to work with a team, so you need good communication skill. You also need understand how to work with customers and explain this to them. you need to use a process the everyone know so it would be easier to coordinate different code from different people in the same team. it also talks about understanding the right tools to use.<br>

<h1 id="2">2: Software Process Models</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Start of Chapter 2 Summary</h3>
this chapter talks about software process models and the four variables which are cost, time, quality, scope also called features. the chapter explain that you'll want to minimize each variables, and find the perfect spot for cost time quality and scope the make the best project. the book also explain that you need to focus on the features part of the project if your are the programmer because the cost and time your won't be able to control. late in the chapter the book talk about the waterfall process and that it's bad because it have you doing one thing then moving to the next its going linear, but that not how coding work people usually have to go back to some other part of the project to fix something or add something
<h3>Mid-Chapter 2 Summary</h3>
<p>Iterative models are an software engineering model that takes a problem and creates a solution one step at a time. A team will take 
the known requirements and prioritize them based on the most important features to the customer. Each iteration of this process is
viewed as a small project that brings constant small updates to a system. This model is implemented through evolutionary prototyping
which prioritizes requirements as they are received. Hence allows for products to contain many new features as time progresses. A
downside to evolutionary prototyping is the overly optimistic views about time, money, and progress. This model becomes sort of
inefficient as more requirements are added. Although the downsides may weigh upon this implementation, it tends to work well with
small, close teams. Although plan-driven models have worked well in the past, the main issue with them is risk. Risk can be in the
form of schedule slips, project cancellation, etc. Agile Methodologies on the other hand recognize this and minimizes the risk. In the
mid 90's a new lightweight-plan-driven model was created. This differed from the heavyweight-plan-driven because it required less
documentation and few process controls for small to medium sized projects. The projects generated by the lightweight model tend to be
used as smaller projects that provide services toward a bigger project. In early 2001 the Agile Manifesto was written. This was a
description of values and 12 principles. The values will be lists at the bottom of the summary*. Another way to develop software is
the eXtreme Programming(XP) method. It was created around 1995 and is described as a "lightweight, efficient, low-risk, flexible,
predictable, scientific, and fun way to develop software." The four fundamental ideas of this method is Heavy customer involvement,
Continuous unit testing, Pair programming, and Short iteration cycles and frequent releases. The ideas around XP programming are
what they say they are. There are a total of four main activities in XP: designing, coding, testing, and listening. Designing is
creating structure that organizes the logic for the system. Coding is the main activity, and testing is very important for debugging.
Listening involves gaining knowledge from your partner or the customer. XP is full of many standards, including its 12 practices(list
below). The second agile methodology is Scrum, named after rugby, which means restarting the play after a rule is broken. Scrum is
older than XP but the main difference is that scrum dev team typically consist of no more than 10 programmers. Similarly to other
agile methods, Scrum puts an emphasis on small team efficacy and collective ownership.</p>

<h3>Agile Values</h3><ul>
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ul>

<h3>Agile Principles</h3><ol>
<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary way to measure progress.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
<li>Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective and then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<h3>12 XP Practices</h3><ul>
<li>The planning game: Develop the scope of the next system release by combining buisness priority and technical issues</li>
<li>Small releases</li>
<li>Metaphor: A simple story of how the system works</li>
<li>Simple Design</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Refactoring: Restructure the system without changing its behavior.</li>
<li>Pair programming</li>
<li>Collective Ownership</li>
<li>Continuous integration</li>
<li>40-hour week: Work a regular 40-hour week</li>
<li>On-site customer: A customer that is apart of the team.</li>
<li>Coding Standards</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="3">3: Project Management Essentials</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
Project management is relevant for developers because if they ever work in a group, they'll either be managed (under a plan-driven system) or have partial responsibility for managing a project (under an Agile system). Project management is made up of three areas: project planning, project oversight, and the retrospective, which occur before, during, and after a project, respectively. The first step of project planning is deciding how the team will be organized, as well as what the process of making the project will be like and what each day of developing will look like. The next step is determining all that could go wrong and how to prevent what can be prevented and deal with the inevitable problems. The next step is figuring out what resources will be needed for the project. Next, the project is broken down into tasks small enough to predict the time needed for each, and that, along with considerations like certain tasks only being doable after other tasks and when developers will actually be able to code, is used to create a schedule for the project (though it's useful to include in the schedule some way to show how well everyone is able to follow the schedule). Project oversight includes meetings to discuss the current state of the project and any problems that anyone has run into. It also includes oversight from a manager to make sure that everything and everyone (including the manager themselves) is working smoothly, which includes providing positive motivation, listening to the developers, and separating the developers from distractions outside their roles. It may also include using a defect tracking system to keep track of defects and make sure they're dealt with. The retrospective is where the time spent on the project is examined to decide what did and didn't work as expected or desired and what should be done differently next time (as well as who will make sure things are done differently).
<h2>Summary</h2>
Understanding project management is required. Tasks involved:
<ul>
<li>Project planning</li>
<li>Estimation and scheduling</li>
<li>Resource management</li>
<li>Project oversight</li>
<li>Project reviews and presentations</li>
<li>The project retrospective</li>
</ul>
Project managers are responsible for
<ul>
<li>managing scope, costs, estimation, schedule, quality, personnel, communication, risk, etc.</li>
</ul>
The team manage the Agile project. They need to make to sure there is no delay in management decision-making. If there is a manager,
<ul>
<li>make sure the team has the resources</li>
<li>ensure the team adheres to agile values and principles</li>
<li>facilitate communication</li>
<li>shield the team from outside interruptions</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="3.1">3.1: Project Planning</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
For a plan-driven process model, a project plan is an actual document of how the project will be managed, written by the project manager.<br><br>

A project plan has seven parts:
<ul>
<li>Introdution and explanation of the project</li>
<li>Team organization</li>
<li>Risk analysis</li>
<li>Hardware, software, and human resource requirements</li>
<li>Task list and size and effort estimates</li>
<li>Project schedule</li>
<li>Project monitoring and reporting mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="3.2">3.2: Project Organization</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Three things for project organization are:
<ul>
<li>How you are going to organize the team</li>
<li>Deciding the process model</li>
<li>Managing the project on day-to-day basis</li>
</ul>
These are important for brand new projects and inexperienced teams because it will help you to start the actual project work.<br><br>

Since Agile team is small, it is easy to organize the project. The code, testings and expertise are all shared within the team. Being in an agile team will improve a lot of skills learning new things doing agile projects.<br><br>

Agile projects are iterative, use short development cycles, and produce running code with more features at the end of each iteration. The team has daily meetings, integrations and shared or paired programming.<br>
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
How are agile projects organized on a daily basis? (Pg: 31)<br><br>

<b class="answer hidden">On a daily basis, developers do daily meetings/integrations. The work iterations are usually very small and most of the time is spent writing executing tests.</b>

<h1 id="3.3">3.3: Risk Analysis</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
We need to think of possible factors that can go wrong and how we are going to prevent from happening.
<ul>
<li>Schedule slips : A task could take longer than we expected. When it happens, we need to report immediately the estimated late time. It could happen often when there is not regular status meetings like plan-driven project.</li>
<li>Defect rate is excessive : If the program has a lot of bugs in tests, we should pause writing codes and look at the code a little bit and clean up the bug.</li>
<li>Requirements misunderstood : Regular meetings and frequent releases will help the misunderstanding between customers and developers.</li>
<li>Requirement churn : To release an update, it requires adding new features and fixing bugs. Churn happens when the customer continues to change requirements while development is underway.</li>
<li>Turnover : Best way to reduce turnover is to 1) give developers interesting work 2) have them work in pleasant enviroment 3) give them control over their own schedules.</li>
</ul>
All the risks are needed to address and find a way to avoid the risk. We can remove some feature from a release, stop work on new features and do a bug hunt, negotiate new features into a future release, which is called mitigation. Then, we should have a plan to handle identifiable risks.<br>

<h1 id="3.5">3.5: Task Estimates</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
(pg 33)<br><br>

The first steps towards a schedule is seeing what you'll be doing and figuring out how long each step will take. Task estimates are just that, estimates. It is impossible to know exactly how long a specific task will take and how accurate the developers prediction is largely based off of experience. The bigger the task the harder it is to know so it is better to breat down tasks that are estimated to take about a week or shorter. Then you can add them together and start doing larger estimates. "The estimation mantra is: size first, then effort and cost estimates, finally schedule."(pg 33) "Managers should never do development estimates. Even if a manager has been a developer in the past, unless they're deeply involved in the actual development work, they shouldn't be in the business of doing development estimates."(pg 34)<br>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
(pg 34-35)<br><br>

Once you have the task estimates you can create a schedule. Important things to think about when making a cycle include the dependencies between tasks, your duty cycle, inclusion of sickdays and vacations, as well as the inability to schedule a developer to work on two tasks at once. It is also usedful to use project-scheduling software to make the schedule. It allows for greater organisation, especially for larger projects. Spolsky's Painless Schedule (pg 35) lists the following that should be in every schedule:
<ul>
<li>Feature name</li>
<li>Tasks within the feature</li>
<li>The Priority of the task</li>
<li>The Original Estimate (in person hours)</li>
<li>The Current Estimate (in person-hours)</li>

<h1 id="3.7">3.7: Velocity</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
(pg 35)<br><br>

The Velocity of a task can also prove useful when creating a schedule. The velocity is defined as the estimated effort of a task, divided by the actual effort. If you overestimate your task, your velocity will be greater than one (your task took less time than you originally thought); if you underestimate, it will be less than one (the task took you longer than you originally thought). Ideally, velocity should be 1.0, but that hardly ever happens. Velocity can be used to give both the manager and the developers an idea of how accurate their predictions are.<br>

<h1 id="3.8">3.8: Project Oversight</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Project oversight is the part of project management that happens during the programming portion of a project. It includes meetings to discuss the current architure, design and code of the project, as well as management of the schedule, developers, process, and the manager themselves. How it is handled is part of the agreed upon project process.<br><br>
The manager also has to keep the developers happy and motivated, mainly by avoiding things like motivating through fear, treating the developers as resources, or allowing the developers to get caught up in distractions outside the realm of writing the program.<br>
</span>

<h1 id="3.9">3.9: Status Reviews and Presentations</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Status reviews are a part of every project, though larger projects have more formal ones. It is important to be honest and direct about your current progress and expected progress before the next review, as well as any problems you've run into. Avoid the temptation to just say what management wants to hear, because that leads to problems later.<br><br>
When giving a presentation, design it around the knowledge level of the audience and the purpose of the presentation. When using PowerPoint, keep the presentations short and to the point, and keep the slides barebones and the bullet points brief and not full sentences.<br>
</span>

<h1 id="3.10">3.10: Defects</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Developers should try to minimize the amount of defects they introduce into their code. Despite this, defects will inevitably find their way into code, so developers should also try to find as many of the defects in code as possible before releasing it. The found defects can be referenced in a defect tracking system, which tracks current known defects and their severity. For example, one possible set of levels of severity is:
<ol>
<li>Fatal: Crashes or non-functioning vital features</li>
<li>Severe: Non-functioning major features</li>
<li>Serious: Non-functioning major features with work-arounds</li>
<li>Annoying: Defect or error that may annoy the user, but doesn't affect functionality</li>
<li>New Feature Request: A request for a new feature (not a defect)</li>
</ol>
When fixing defects, developers should start with the highest severity ones. Developers should never release a product with Fatal or Severe defects in it, and in most cases should also remove Serious defects.<br>
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
if you don't know what the defect is how would you make a defect tracking system if you don't know what your tracking?<br><br>

<b class="answer hidden">you have to wait till the program is being used and a defect happen in order to track similar defects.</b>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Retrospectives are done after completing some goal, whether a project or major iteration under a plan-driven process, or an iteration, such as a sprint, under an agile process. During retrospectives, questions are asked about the developers' experience completing the goal, such as:
<ol>
<li>What went right? Did things go as expected, and did we implement all the features the customer wanted?</li>
<li>What went wrong? How many defects did we need to deal with, and how much overtime did we need to finish on time?</li>
<li>What process issues came up? Which aspects of our planned process were problematic or infeasable in practice?</li>
<li>What do we need to fix for next time? Given our answers to the previous questions, what do we need to fix in our process, work habits, or environment for the next project?</li>
<li>Who's responsible for the fixes? Who should be in charge of making sure we follow our modified process?</li>

<h1 id="4">4: Requirements (Pg: 39)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
Before starting work on implementing a project, developers need to first work out the functional requirements for the project in order to be productive and make quality, useful code. Functional requirements are descriptions of what the end product must be able to do, from the users' perspective (meaning without any mention of the implementation). Functional requirements must be written in a natural language in order to make it easiest to imagine and describe possible features. Requirements include descriptions of what the users will see and do when using the product, mentions of the ways the product must function due to the areas it works in (income tax, wireless communication), descriptions of the more technical, non-obvious functions and qualities that the product must have to avoid the users having a frustrating or harmful experience, and pointed mentions of the things that are not currently considered requirements. There are different forms of functional requirements for plan-driven and agile projects. Plan-driven projects have functional specifications, which are written by one person (likely a manager), and include a brief description of the product's intended functionality and multiple scenarios describing various intended possible user experiences, along with excessively clear mention of whether the specification is final and uncertainties to bring up in the next meeting with the customer. Agile projects have user stories, which are descriptions of what the customer wants the product to be able to do or what they want to be able to do using the product, ideally along with mention of which types of users will want which things out of the product and why. There are three aspects to a user story. The first is writing on an object such as a note card or piece of paper containing a brief description of the user story and representing the need for further discussion of the user story. The second is said discussion, which should be a thorough, in-person discussion between all who have a stake or role in the successful creation of the product and should determine more of what the customer wants and the size and priority of the story, as well as whether the story should be broken into more manageable chunks. The third is what criteria the product should meet in order to have successfully implemented the user story, which will be converted into tests that can determine whether the user story has been followed successfully. User stories need to be clear enough that tests can determine that a story has been met, vague enough that developers can be creative and thoughtful in their implementation, small enough that the effort required to implement them can be estimated, not dependent on other stories being implemented first, and beneficial to the customer. Before implementation, user stories must be broken down into multiple implementation tasks, which must be very clear such that you can definitively tell when they're done, achievable with the developers and time allocated for them, and necessary to the implementation of the user story they're in service of. Getting the functional requirements from the customer can be difficult because they may say that the product should follow some current business policy that may change (and possibly necessitate a change to the product) in the future, they may describe unnecessary details of their ideal final product in place of the fundamentals of the product's purpose, they may not know exactly what they want from the product, the developers and customer may struggle to communicate in terms the other understands, the requirements will inevitably change over the course of the project, and the customer may bicker amongst themselves. Once the functional requirements have been determined, they need to be categorized, prioritized, and examined to determine if each is consistent with the intended function of the final product, necessary to implement the essential functionality of the product, testable, doable given the resources being worked with, and unambiguous.

<h2>Section Summary</h2>
As programmers, we are more inclined to just start writing code and fix the problems on the go. That practice is not very productive and can lead to a lot of trouble in the grand scheme of a project. To avoid such problems, a programmer needs to determine a set of requirements before they start working on the actual code. 

<h2>Summary of Pages 47-51</h2>
chapter 4 is a interesting chapter it talked about requirements, and it was in three parts, requirements, requirement Digging, and analyzing the requirements. on pages 47-49 it listed out a few requirements for example measurable it being able to understand what needs to be done and be able to understand how long it would take to complete that program. also chapter 4 on pages 49-50 it talked about requirements digging or requirements elicitation, which is being able to get a user to tell you what they want. and being able to know that requirements hat customer don't know that want yet.
one requirements elicitation is problems of scope which is being able to know what a customer want and make sure it can be done in the time limit required. the last part is analyzing the requirement which is taking the time to see if the requirements are really needed and is it consistent with the overall projects objective.

<h1 id="4.14">4.14: Design and New Feature Ideas (Pg. 43-44)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Project managers and developers create two different types of notes. These types of notes are technical notes containing design or coding ideas for developers. An example of these notes can consist of a backlog: A set of notes containing requirements that are to be implemented on the next release.
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
What are three positives of Backlogs?
<b class="answer hidden">
<ol>
<li>lets the customer know you haven't forgotten about those features.</li>
<li>lets the customer know that by moving these features to the next release you are committed to delivering the current release as close to the published schedule as possible.</li>
<li>it tells the developers that you're not out of control and that the project has a good shot at being done with high quality and on time.</li>
</ol>
</b>
</span>

<h1 id="4.15">4.15: One More Thing (pg.44)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Don't spend all of you're time obsessing about making sure every functional specification is correct. Chances are the customer will add additional requirements anyway. Also functional specifications are only considered complete after ship and release, so once again don't obsess.
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
When is the only time a functional specification is complete?<br><br>
<b class="answer hidden">When you ship the release.<br></b>
</span>

<h1 id="4.16">4.16: Requirements Gathering in an Agile Project (pg.44)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
There is no functional specification in an agile development project. This is because developers of an agile team recognize that requirements will change over the course of a project and embrace that.  There is no need to gather requirements because an agile development team contains the customer as part of the team. That way there is room for immediate feedback, and timely updates on requirements.

<h1 id="4.17">4.17: The Three Cs (pg.44)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
A user story has 3 fundamental components: the card, the conversation, and the confirmation.
</span>

<h1 id="4.18">4.18: Card (pg.45)</h1>
<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
A piece of paper, index card etc. Any physical thing in which the user story is written on. This acts as an invitation to a collaborative conversation about what the story really is and wants.
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
A card is usually a detailed story?:
<ol type="a">
<li class="answer wrong">True</li>
<li class="answer right">False</li>
</ol>
</span>

<h1 id="4.19">4.19: Conversation (pg.45)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Takes place between important stakeholders in the project. This conversation essentially covers material that the owner really wants to see in the story. This can include revisions to the story, time estimates, and more details about the story.
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
The conversation about a user story takes place between all the important stakeholders in the project?:
<ol type="a">
<li class="answer right">True</li>
<li class="answer wrong">False</li>
</ol>
</span>

<h1 id="4.20">4.20: Confirmation (pg.45)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
The last component of the user story. The product owner provides this as the final form of acceptance criteria for the story. Typically very simple and written on the back of the card as bullet points.
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
What format are the acceptance criteria usually written in?:
<ol type="a">

</b>
</span>

<h1 id="4.22">4.22: Independent (pg.45)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Each user story should be independent of each other. That way a single user story can be scheduled and implemented separately from any other user story. This can be important based on which agile process a team is using.
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
Stories should be dependent on each other?:

</ol>
</span>

<h1 id="4.23">4.23: Negotiable (pg.46)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
A good story has room for negotiation among the parties involved. This should leave the developer and owner room to create an unique and workable implementation.
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
The story is specific that reads like a contract?:
<ol type="a">

</ol>
</span>

<h1 id="4.24">4.24: Valuable (pg.46)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
A good user story must have some kind of value to the customer. It must describe a feature or service that will be implemented in the product before the iteration is complete. Also, if a teams user story is too long, they should separate them into two smaller stories to be implemented in two different iterations.
</span>

<span class="questions">

Should splitting stories be based on value to the customer or technology?:<br><br>
<b class="answer hidden">Value to the customer.<br></b>
</span>

<h1 id="4.25">4.25: Estimable (pg.46)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Estimation is apart of the negotiation on the conversation. User stories must be able to be estimated because the product owner needs to be able to assign a relative priority to the story. Stories should not be too long, if so they might be subject to story splitting for a future iteration.
</span>

<span class="questions">

<h1 id="4.26">4.26: Small (pg.46)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
As stated a few times above, good user stories should be relatively small. This also helps increase the accuracy of the user story estimation. Rule of thumb: Should take no more than eight man-hours of work to complete.

<h2>Chapter Summary</h2>

</span>

<h1 id="18.1">18.1: Introduction to Ethics (pg. 283)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Ethics is the study of how to decide if something is right or wrong. For us, in this chatper, we are considered as software developers and there are compter ethics for software developers. These ethics are all related to colleges, mangaers, and customers which can then effect on ourselves, company and on the users.
</span>

<h1 id="18.2">18.2: Ethical Theory (pg. 284)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Here ethics is the sutdy of what it means to do the right thing and how to do right thing in different situations. There are ethical rules that need to follow when we deal with other people. The rules includes considering the actions or decisions effect other people, keeping promises, being honest and not stealing.
</span>

<h1 id="18.3">18.3: Deontological Theories (pg. 284-286)</h1>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Deontologists believe people's acitons should be guided by the moral laws and they need to be universal which can apply in any matter. The arguments focus on the intent of an act and how that act is or is not defensible as an application of a moral law which do not concern with consequences of an act. The fundamental ideas of deontological theory that Kant contributed are - the ethical rules must be universal which could be appply for any cases, the law should respect rational human beings and they are logically correct or reasonably accpected. Adavantages of deontological ethics are that - they are rational which means they can be explained logically, they are morally universal judgments, and there is no discrimination. Disatvantages are that the rules are so universal that they can get conflicted and the deintological arguments can not reslove the conflict and they do much concern about the consequences.
</span>

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
How does one determine whether a moral rule is correct or good?<br><br>
<b class="answer hidden">A moral rule can be tested using the principle of universality. The book takes the example of promises to demonstrate the use of this principle. The moral being tested here is <em>I am allowed to make promises with the intention of breaking them later.</em> Applying this rule universally, we reach the conclusion that the word <em>promise</em> stops having a meaning if one can just break it at will based on their circumstances. Hence, the rule does not stand the universality principle.<br><br></b>
if an action is only moral when can be back up by reason, what happen when one person reason for doing something is different then another person reals for doing something which reason do you chose?<br><br>
<b class="answer hidden">there needs to be some law that don't care about your reason to decide if its right or wrong. for example I steal food to feed my family, my reason is a rational I have a family that will die if they don't eat.<br></b>

Deontological Theories
<ol>
<li>"here are ethical constants and rules that must apply universally": everyone should follow some  moral law, then people won't be confused on what's right and what's wrong everyone would follow the same moral laws</li>
<li>"You should always act so as to treat yourself and others as ends in themselves and
not means to an end": don't take advantage of people. treat people like you want to be treated.</li>
<li>"Logic or reason determine the rules of ethical behavior": your actions need to be back by reason in order for it to be morally right.</li>
</ol>
good thing about Deontological:(286)
<ol>
<li>is it rational: is your actions backed by reason</li>
<li>the principle of universality produces universal moral guidelines: can this role apply to everyone no matter what.</li>
<li>everyone is morally equals</li>
</ol>
Bad thing about Deontological:(286)
<ol>
<li>no single rule can fully characterize an action: you can break one rule for another one.</li>
<li>there isn't a way to resolve an conflict between two or more moral rules.</li>
<li>there isn't any exception to the rules</li>

<span class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
Consequentialism or Teleological theory thinks about the consequences of the act in addition to the act itself. These theroies "give priority to the good over the right and evaluate actions by the goal or consequences that they produce, hence the name consequentialism."(287) A classic form of consequentialism is utilitarianism in which if the net sum of happiness after an action is positive the act is good, if it is negative it is bad. It aims to create the largest net good for the greatest number. In the exampe of building a new, straighter highway we need ot think about the net good done. So this includes the positives of a fuel saved by all commuters, need for the state to maintain the road, the people that will need to be relocated and more.

<span class="questions">
<h2>Questions</h2>
What are the downsides of <em>act utilitarianism</em>?<br><br>
<b class="answer hidden">This type of utilitarianism leads us down a path of complex calculations based on the ethical components of the action being evaluated. It also hinges heavily on <em>moral luck</em>.<br><br></b>
How is <em>act utilitarianism</em> different than <em>rule utilitarianism</em>?<br><br>
<b class="answer hidden">Act utilitarianism is the theory that says that an action is good if its net effect produces more happiness than unhappiness. Rule utilitarianism uses the same principle and only applies it to ethical rules instead of individual actions.<br></b>
