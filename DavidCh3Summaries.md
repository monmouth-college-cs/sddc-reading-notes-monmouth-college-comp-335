#Project Oversight

Project oversight is the part of project management that happens during the programming portion of a project. It includes meetings to discuss the current architure, design and code of the project, as well as management of the schedule, developers, process, and the manager themselves. How it is handled is part of the agreed upon project process. 

The manager also has to keep the developers happy and motivated, mainly by avoiding things like motivating through fear, treating the developers as resources, or allowing the developers to get caught up in distractions outside the realm of writing the program.

#Status Reviews and Presentations

Status reviews are a part of every project, though larger projects have more formal ones. It is important to be honest and direct about your current progress and expected progress before the next review, as well as any problems you've run into. Avoid the temptation to just say what management wants to hear, because that leads to problems later.

When giving a presentation, design it around the knowledge level of the audience and the purpose of the presentation. When using PowerPoint, keep the presentations short and to the point, and keep the slides barebones and the bullet points brief and not full sentences.

#Defects

Developers should try to minimize the amount of defects they introduce into their code. Despite this, defects will inevitably find their way into code, so developers should also try to find as many of the defects in code as possible before releasing it. The found defects can be referenced in a defect tracking system, which tracks current known defects and their severity. For example, one possible set of levels of severity is:

1. Fatal: Crashes or non-functioning vital features
2. Severe: Non-functioning major features
3. Serious: Non-functioning major features with work-arounds
4. Annoying: Defect or error that may annoy the user, but doesn't affect functionality
5. New Feature Request: A request for a new feature (not a defect)

When fixing defects, developers should start with the highest severity ones. Developers should never release a product with Fatal or Severe defects in it, and in most cases should also remove Serious defects.

#The Retrospective

Retrospectives are done after completing some goal, whether a project or major iteration under a plan-driven process, or an iteration, such as a sprint, under an agile process. During retrospectives, questions are asked about the developers' experience completing the goal, such as:

1. What went right? Did things go as expected, and did we implement all the features the customer wanted?
2. What went wrong? How many defects did we need to deal with, and how much overtime did we need to finish on time?
3. What process issues came up? Which aspects of our planned process were problematic or infeasable in practice?
4. What do we need to fix for next time? Given our answers to the previous questions, what do we need to fix in our process, work habits, or environment for the next project?
5. Who's responsible for the fixes? Who should be in charge of making sure we follow our modified process?

#Conclusion

The developers should own the process and management should be supportive, listen to the developers (especially when it comes to schedules and estimates), and seperate the developers from distractions outside their roles.
