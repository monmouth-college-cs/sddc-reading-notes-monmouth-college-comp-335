# Chapter 18 Summary of Summaries
Chapter 18 begins by introducing ethics as the study of how to decide if something is right or wrong. This relates to software development through computer ethics, which are ethical issues that a computer professional will face over the course of their career. All professional decisions you make will also have an ethical aspect to it. The ethical components all must apply these three fundamental ideas:
1. There are ethical constants and rules that must apply universally.
2. You should always act so as to treat yourself and others as ends in themselves and not means to an end.
3. Logic and reason determine the rules of ethical behavior.
By using moral and professional ethical rules, it becomes more clear to create a rational and ethical decision. Failing to recognize the correct ethical behavior can result in legal and other forms of trouble.
