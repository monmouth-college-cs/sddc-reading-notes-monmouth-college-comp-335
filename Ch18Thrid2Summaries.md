## Consequentialism (Teleological Theories)

Consequentialism or Teleological theory thinks about the consequences of the act in addition to the act itself. These theroies "give priority to the good over the right and evaluate actions by the goal or consequences that they produce, hence the name consequentialism."(287) A classic form of consequentialism is utilitarianism in which if the net sum of happiness after an action is positive the act is good, if it is negative it is bad. It aims to create the largest net good for the greatest number. In the exampe of building a new, straighter highway we need ot think about the net good done. So this includes the positives of a fuel saved by all commuters, need for the state to maintain the road, the people that will need to be relocated and more. 

# Ethical Drivers

## Legal Drivers

"In all ethical discussions we must consider the law because laws constrain our actions and also guide us down ethical paths that society has decided are acceptable behaviour"

## Professional Drivers

Professions have sets of ethical drivers that decribe how members of that profession are expected to behave. There are codes of conduct for every profession including software development.
