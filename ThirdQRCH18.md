## Ethical Discussion and Decision Making (pg. 291)
### Identifying and Describing the Problem (pg. 291)
1. Write down the statement of the ethical problem. This will help to clarify what
exactly you’re talking about.
2. List the risks, problems, and possible consequences.
3. List all the stakeholders. This will include you and anyone else involved in the
ethical situation and anyone involved in the consequences of the decision.
4. Identify all the basic ethical issues in each case. Try to establish the rights and
wrongs of the situation and figure out what ethical rules might be involved.
5. Identify any legal issues. This includes intellectual property issues and health
and safety issues.
6. List possible actions if the problem is more complex than a simple yes/no.

### Analyzing the Problem (pgs.291-292)
1. What are your first impressions or reactions to these issues? What do your morals say?
2. Identify the responsibilities of the decision maker. This involves things like reporting ethical problems if you’re an employee and what your responsibilities might be as a manager.
3. Identify the rights of the stakeholders.
4. Consider the consequences of the action options on the stakeholders. Analyze the consequences, risks, benefits, harms, and costs for each action considered.
5. Find the sections of the SE Code and the ACM code that pertain to the problem and the actions. This will help you with the ethical rules and in laying out the situation so you can consider alternatives.
6. Consider the deontological and utilitarian approaches to the problem. You’ll need to have the ethical rules you’ve considered in front of you, as well as the sections of the SE and ACM codes of ethics. Then run through our examples here of other ethical situations and then follow those examples for your own situation.
7. Do the ethical theories point to one course of action? If more than one, which one should take precedence? List the different courses of action and then, if necessary, try to prioritize them. This will help you think about different courses of action.
8. Which of the potential actions do you think is the right one? Pick it. If you’re
using a utilitarian approach, you might consider picking a metric.
9. If there are several ethically acceptable options, pick one.

### Fundamental Ethical Principals (pgs. 293-294)
1. Be impartial: You will have some amount of loyalty to your company, but you also must have loyalty to society as a whole and to yourself.
2. Disclose information that others ought to have: Don’t hide information from people who need to know it. Don’t be deceptive or deliberately misleading. Make sure you disclose any conflicts of interest.
3. Respect the rights of others: This includes intellectual property rights, civil rights,
and other property rights. Don’t steal intellectual property or misuse others property.
4. Treat others justly: Don’t discriminate against others for attributes unrelated to their job. Make sure that others receive fair wages and benefits and credit for work done.
5. Take responsibility for your own actions and inactions: Take responsibility for everything you do—or don’t do—whether good or bad.
6. Take responsibility for the actions of those you supervise: The old saying “The buck stops here” applies to you as a manager as well. This also includes making sure you communicate effectively with your employees.
7. Maintain your integrity: Deliver on your commitments. Be loyal to your employer
(as long as they also operate in an ethical manner). Don’t ask someone to do anything you wouldn’t do yourself!!
8. Continually improve your abilities: Software development and the computer industry as a whole are in a constant state of flux. Tools and languages you used in college will be obsolete five years later. Make sure you’re a life-long learner.
9. Share your knowledge, expertise, and values: The more experience you acquire in your profession, the more you’re obligated to share your knowledge and
expertise with your co-workers and subordinates. You should also set an example for others by living these values.
