Ethics is the study of how to decide if something is right or wrong, and how best to live. For software developers, ethical questions generally involve their relationships with and the effects of their decisions on their colleagues, managers, and customers. Ethical theory is based on the assumption that people are rational and make free choices, so we can assume people are responsible for their own decisions and actions for the sake of ethical decision-making. Two different ethical schools of thought are deontoligical and consequentialist. Deontologists believe that there are universal moral laws that must be followed to be moral. They generally don't consider the consequences of your actions to be that relevant to morality. Three fundamental ideas of deontological theory are that moral rules must be applicable to every situation without issue, you must interact with others for its own sake and not to get something out of it, and ethical rules must be logical and rational. Benefits of deontological thinking are that it is rational, always applicable (due to the universality of moral laws), and non-discriminatory. Disadvantages are that there are situations to which multiple conflicting moral laws are applicable and deontological thought doesn't help decide which law to follow in these cases, and deontological thought doesn't allow breaking moral rules to avoid negative consequences. Consequentialist theory (also known as teleological theory) is based around the goals and consequences of actions, rather than any inherant morality of the actions themselves. Utilitarianism is a form of consequentalism in which the morality of an action is decided by determining the total amount of happiness caused by the action, subtracting the total amount of unhappiness or loss of happiness caused by the action, and deeming the action moral only if the result is positive. Applying utilitarianism to individual actions has the problems that it is somewhat infeasable due to the significant amount of time and effort it takes to determine every effect of an action, and the fact that consequences can be affected by things outside of the actor's control. Another form of utilitarianism that solves these problems is rule utilitarianism, in which utilitarianism is used to decide the morality of moral rules (similar to those in teleological thought) by examining the positive and negative consequences of everyone following each rule. The main issue with consequentalism is that it doesn't consider the distribution of the happiness created or removed by an action. An action that creates more total happiness for fewer people is considered more moral. This can be somewhat solved by applying the two principles of justice, making sure everyone has an equal chance to improve their social or economic standing and allowing social and economic inequalities only when the inequality provides the most benefit to the least advantaged. When making ethical decisions, the law is important because it eliminates options and ideally shows what society has decided is unacceptable behavior. It is also important to look at codes of conduct created by professional societies such as the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society to see how professionals have decided they and others in their field should act. One possible process for making an ethical decision involves identifying and describing the problem (including possible decisions, the possible consequences of each choice, and all relevant laws and ethical issues and rules) and then analyzing the problem and coming to a conclusion (by looking at things such as intuition, responsibilities, rights, codes of conduct, and ethical theories). Some specific ethical principles that software developers should follow are "Be impartial", "Disclose information that others ought to have", "Respect the rights of others", "Treat others justly", "Take responsibility for your own actions and inactions", "Take responsibility for the actions of those you supervise", "Maintain your integrity", "Continually improve your abilities", and "Share your knowledge, expertise and values".
