Description: This file contains a Summary of summaries, discussion questions, and references for the middle of chapter 3 (pgs.33-35 + velocity on pg.36).

### Summary of Summaries ###
 ** TBD **
 -----------------------------

### Discussion Questions ###
# What is NOT a variable in the estimation mantra? # (pg.33)
 * Effort and Costs
 * Program Size
 * Program Quality
 * Schedule
 - The Answer is 'Program Quality'

# What is the Delphi estimation technique? (short answer) # (pg.33)
 - Answer: Give a developer work to do, after they have some time to consider the solution ask them for 3 numbers. These 3 numbers represent:
 1. The minimum amount of time it will take to complete
 2. The maximum amount of time it will take to complete
 3. The normal amount of time it will take to complete

# What is the ideal velocity of a project? # (pg.35)
 * 0
 * 2.0
 * 1.0
 * 0.5
  - The Answer is '1.0'

# True or false, the ideal velocity is commonly achieved? # (pg.36)
 * False
 * True
 - Answer is false.

# What is a duty cycle? (Short Answer) # (pg.35)
 - Answer should say something along the lines of:
 * "The amount of person hours (per day) a developer actually spends developing software"

# How many items are in Spolsky's Painless schedule? # (pg.35)
 * 7
 * 5
 * 11
 * 9
 - Answer is '9'.

# Project Schedule # (pg. 34)
Once you have time estimates for an iteration, you can create a schedule. 4 items (below) state what you should consider while creating the schedule.
 * Have developers state the dependencies between tasks. Some can't start until other dependencies finish.
 * Find out what the duty cycle is.
 * Consider weekends, vacations, sick days, training, etc.
 * One developer can only one task at a time.

# Spolsky's Painless Schedule # (pg. 35)
 * Feature name
 * Future tasks
 * The priority of the task
 * The original estimate in person hours
 * The current estimate in person hours
 * The elapsed time in person hours
 * The remaining time in person hours

# Velocity # (pgs. 35-36)
 * Allows managers and developers to have an idea of how accurate their estimates were. This allows for schedule improvement. PG.35-36
