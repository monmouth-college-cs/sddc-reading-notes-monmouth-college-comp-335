 2. The maximum amount of time it will take to complete
 3. The normal amount of time it will take to complete

# What is the ideal velocity of a project? #
 * 0
 * 2.0
 * 1.0

# Project Schedule #
Once you have time estimates for an iteration, you can create a schedule. 4 items (below) state what you should consider while creating the schedule.
 * Have developers state the dependencies between tasks. Some can't start until other dependencies finish.
 * Find out what the duty cycle is.
 * Consider weekends, vacations, sick days, training, etc.
 * One developer can only one task at a time.

# Spolsky's Painless Schedule #
 * Feature name
 * Future tasks
 * The priority of the task
 * The original estimate in person hours
 * The current estimate in person hours
 * The elapsed time in person hours
 * The remaining time in person hours

# Velocity #
 * Allows managers and developers to have an idea of how accurate their estimates were. This allows for schedule improvement. PG.35-36
