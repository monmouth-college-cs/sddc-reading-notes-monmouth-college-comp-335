# Requirements (Pg: 39)

As programmers, we are more inclined to just start writing code and fix the problems on the go. That practice is not very productive and can lead to a lot of trouble in the grand scheme of a project. To avoid such problems, a programmer needs to determine a set of requirements before they start working on the actual code. 

## Types of requirements (Pg: 39)

We care about *functional requirements*. They are the features that a user will experience when using the product. There are four types of those requirements:
1. User Requirements
2. Domain Requirements
3. Non-functional Requirements
4. Non-requirements

### User Requirements (Pg: 40)

Always written in natural language; things that a user expects to see in their screen. This would include things like the descriptions of screen layouts, dialog boxes, and menus. Creating scenarios is helpful. Use visuals (pictures, mock-up webspages) to better understand and discuss the requirements.

### Domain Requirements (Pg: 40)

These are more like guidelines for the design of your product based on the industry you are working in. These are usually set universaly and the programmer doesn't necessarily need to write them down. They just need to refer to them in order to remain in the set guidelines. Users would be not be concerned with these requirements as long as the user experience is not affected.

### Non-functional Requirements (Pg: 40)

These are the constraints that the programmer has to work within. Some of the examples would include target platform specifications, timing constraints, performance requirements, memory usage requirements etc. They do affect the user experience but are not visible to the user.

### Non-requirements (Pg: 41)

There are certain things the final product will not be able to do. The programmer needs to communicate these things to the client so they can manage their expectations. 

## Gathering Requirements (Pg: 41)

We are only concerned about the *functional requirements* during this phase of planning. Those requirements are just the things that the user will experience, written down in simple layman's terms. 

### But you don't like writing, you say? (Pg : 41)

The Sapir-Whorf linguistic relativity hypothesis, when roughly paraphrased, says that our ability to think and express those thoughts is limited by the language that we use. Using more expressive language can boost the effectiveness of figuring the requirements. That means it is highly recommended that the programmers write things down in regular, more expressive language before using the computer languages to implement the coding process.

## Outline of a Functional Specification (Pg: 42)

Different projects have different specifications. The elements of functional specifications are:

1. Overview
2. Disclaimer
3. Author's name
4. Scenarios of typical usage
5. Open Issues

### Overview (Pg: 42)

This is the executive summary of the product. It briefly explains what the program is supposed to do.

### Disclaimer (Pg: 42)

Make sure to violently declare that things are not finalised in the planning phase and if somebody believes something is wrong/missing, it can be fixed using proper communication.

### Author's Name (Pg: 42 - 43)

It is usually either the Development Manager or the Project Manager, based on how to organization operates. There are pros and cons to both of them. Ideally, the author should be able to understand the technical aspects well enough to write proper specifications meanwhile also having good people skills to be able to get the stakeholders on board with everything.
