Before starting work on implementing a project, developers need to first work out the functional requirements for the project in order to be productive and make quality, useful code. Functional requirements are descriptions of what the end product must be able to do, from the users' perspective (meaning without any mention of the implementation). Functional requirements must be written in a natural language in order to make it easiest to imagine and describe possible features. Requirements include descriptions of what the users will see and do when using the product, mentions of the ways the product must function due to the areas it works in (income tax, wireless communication), descriptions of the more technical, non-obvious functions and qualities that the product must have to avoid the users having a frustrating or harmful experience, and pointed mentions of the things that are not currently considered requirements. There are different forms of functional requirements for plan-driven and agile projects. Plan-driven projects have functional specifications, which are written by one person (likely a manager), and include a brief description of the product's intended functionality and multiple scenarios describing various intended possible user experiences, along with excessively clear mention of whether the specification is final and uncertainties to bring up in the next meeting with the customer. Agile projects have user stories, which are descriptions of what the customer wants the product to be able to do or what they want to be able to do using the product, ideally along with mention of which types of users will want which things out of the product and why. There are three aspects to a user story. The first is writing on an object such as a note card or piece of paper containing a brief description of the user story and representing the need for further discussion of the user story. The second is said discussion, which should be a thorough, in-person discussion between all who have a stake or role in the successful creation of the product and should determine more of what the customer wants and the size and priority of the story, as well as whether the story should be broken into more manageable chunks. The third is what criteria the product should meet in order to have successfully implemented the user story, which will be converted into tests that can determine whether the user story has been followed successfully. User stories need to be clear enough that tests can determine that a story has been met, vague enough that developers can be creative and thoughtful in their implementation, small enough that the effort required to implement them can be estimated, not dependent on other stories being implemented first, and beneficial to the customer. Before implementation, user stories must be broken down into multiple implementation tasks, which must be very clear such that you can definitively tell when they're done, achievable with the developers and time allocated for them, and necessary to the implementation of the user story they're in service of. Getting the functional requirements from the customer can be difficult because they may say that the product should follow some current business policy that may change (and possibly necessitate a change to the product) in the future, they may describe unnecessary details of their ideal final product in place of the fundamentals of the product's purpose, they may not know exactly what they want from the product, the developers and customer may struggle to communicate in terms the other understands, the requirements will inevitably change over the course of the project, and the customer may bicker amongst themselves. Once the functional requirements have been determined, they need to be categorized, prioritized, and examined to determine if each is consistent with the intended function of the final product, necessary to implement the essential functionality of the product, testable, doable given the resources being worked with, and unambiguous.
