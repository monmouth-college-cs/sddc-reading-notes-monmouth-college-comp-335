#### chapter 18 Questions
if an action is only moral when can be back up by reason, what happen when one person reason for doing something is different then another person reals for doing something which reason do you chose?

answer: there needs to be some law that don't care about your reason to decide if its right or wrong. for example I steal food to feed my family, my reason is a rational I have a family that will die if they don't eat.

###### Deontological Theories
1. "here are ethical constants and rules that must apply universally": everyone should follow some  moral law, then people won't be confused on what's right and what's wrong everyone would follow the same moral laws.
2. "You should always act so as to treat yourself and others as ends in themselves and
not means to an end": don't take advantage of people. treat people like you want to be treated.

3. "Logic or reason determine the rules of ethical behavior": your actions need to be back by reason in order for it to be morally right.

###### good thing about Deontological:(286)

1.  is it rational: is your actions backed by reason

2.  the principle of universality produces universal moral guidelines: can this role apply to everyone no matter what.

3.  everyone is morally equals

###### Bad thing about Deontological:(286)

1. no single rule can fully characterize an action: you can break one rule for another one.

2.  there isn't a way to resolve an conflict between two or more moral rules.

3.  there isn't any exception to the rules
