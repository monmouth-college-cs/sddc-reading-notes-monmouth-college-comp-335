# Cummulative summary of chapter 3

For proper project management, things that developers need to worry about are:

-   **Project Planning**: Everyone is responsible for everything in an agile project. Project manager drafts the plan and everyone signs off on it. Plans are fluid.

    -   **Project Organization**: Small iterations of work, wth regular meetings and lots of testing
    -   **Risks**: Figure out the risks beforehand and try to avoid them. If the problem is inevitable, tell everyone ASAP.
    -   **Resource Requirements**: Know your resources and use them wisely (developers, software, hardware, etc.)

-   **Task Estimates**: Estimates are required for scheduling. Smaller tasks are much easier to estimate compared to larger ones. Only developers should estimate the task.

    -   **Project Schedule**: Account for everything (duty cycle, sick days, vacation, dependencies between tasks, etc.) when making schedules. Use Spolski's Painless Schedule technique. 
    -   **Velocity**: Estimate of effort, divided by actual effort. Ideal velocity should be 1.0.
    -   **Project Oversight**: Used to look over the programming. Meetings discuss architecture, design and code, and management of the resources.

-   **Status Reviews and Presentations**: Be honest and direct. Stay brief in presentation slides. 

-   **Defects**: Minimize the defects. Have a defect severity tracking system. Fix the worst ones first and go down the list.
