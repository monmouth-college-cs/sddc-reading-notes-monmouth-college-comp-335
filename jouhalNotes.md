##The Sprint

A Sprint is an iteration of between one and four weeks. It's a fixed duration period and its output is determined by the amount of work done by the team in that period. 

##Scrum Artifacts

Two backlogs in Scrum. 
1. Product Backlog: Created by the product owner. Is a list of all product requirements. Prioritised by the owner. 
2. Sprint Backlog: Created by the dev. team. Breakdown of the product backlog into a prioritized list. Usually a visual board(physical or digital). 
In an ongoing sprint, only the devs can add tasks to the sprint backlog. Outside entities can only add to the product backlog. 

##Sprint Flow

Planning phase before sprint starts. User stories are divided into prioritized groups. Fill up the time allotted with tasks. No task in a sprint is longer than one day of work. Breaking the tasks down makes it easier to estimate them. 
Daily scrum meetings. No longer than 30 minutes. Help track progress. 
After everything is done, a final scrum brings closure to the whole process. Requirements left in the product backlog is added to the next release. 

##Lean Software Development

Set of principles designed to improve productivity, quality and customer satisfaction. 

Seven key principles of Poppendiecks:
1. Eliminate waste: Eliminate everything that doesn't add value to the product. 
2. Build quality in: Two techniques used to improve quality; Pair programming and Test driven development (TDD). Constant feedback is another technique. 
3. Create knowledge: The team must learn new things constantly. 
4. Defer commitment: To make the big, irreversible decisions for later. 
5. Deliver fast: Make it reasonably as fast as possible. Stick to the lean principles to optimize that. 
6. Respect people: Pretty clear
7. Optimize the whole: Keep the bigger picture in mind. 

##Kanban 

Derived from lean manufacturing. Three main ideas: work-in-progress, flow and lead time. 

##Kanban Board, WIP and Flow 

WIP and flow depicted visually on a Kanban board. Similar to a scrum task board. 

##Lead Time

It's the amount of time it takes for the team to move a task from one column to another in the kanban board. The date the task is started in the ToDo column is called entry date. The day it's done in called the done date.
