# Ethics and Professional Practice

## Intro to Ethics
Ethics are "rules" that allow us to decide the right from wrong. As software developers, we are expected to maintain these ethics as they apply in the realm of computer science.

## Ethical Theory
The ethical theory is an attempt to understand how to deal with ethical conundrums that the software developers might face when designing certain types of software. The theory is then used to construct ethical rules that the software developers then follow. 

There are two main types of Ethical Theories:

1. Deontological Theory: Ethical decisions should be guided by moral law and should apply universaly. The rules should be logically sane and rational. Since the rules are morally universal, they don't discriminate. The universality does present some conflicts that are hard to resolve with these rules. There is also little to no concern for consequenses of the said rules(or actions based on those rules).

2. Consequentialism (Teleological Theory): Here, the actions are evaluated based on the outcome. The good is prioritized over the right. Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialist theory that weight the happiness induced after an act. If the net sum is positive, the act is considered good. 

## Ethical Drivers
In the world of computing and software development, there are two main ethical drivers that help set and maintain the ethical rules. Namely,

1. Legal Drivers: The state, federal and international laws should always be considered as there is no way around them. Hence, legal drivers pay a big role in setting the rules.

2. Professional Drivers: Every profession has certain professional codes of conduct they have to follow. The ethics in sofware development world are defined by the *Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)* and the *IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS)*.

## Ethical Discussion and Decision-making
Here are some general steps that can be followed during ethical decision-making:

1. Identifying and describing a problem: Writing down the problem; list the risks and consequences; make a list of everyone affected by the decision; identify all the ethical issues and the rules that might apply; identify the legal issues; list possible actions in case of a more complex conundrum

2. Analyzing the Problem: Check your moral intuition; identify your responsibilities; identify the rights of those involved or affected by the issue; consider the consequences; refer to the rules of the professional drivers like ACM; try using the deontological and utilitarian theories for the issue; list each course of action; choose the best option; if two or more actions seem equally good, pick one and reflect
