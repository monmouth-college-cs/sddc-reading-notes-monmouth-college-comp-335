# Chapter 4 cummulative summary of all summaries

This chapter focuses on the requirements part of the initial planning process. It is very important to map out the various types of requirements so that the scope of the project is clear to the developers. 

## Types of requirements:

1. User Requirements: Things that the user gets to see when they look at the screen and operate the program.
2. Domain Requirements: Industry based design guildelines
3. Non-functional Requirements: Constraints that the programmer has to work within.
4. Non-requirements: Features that will not be available on the final product. Things that the program can't do.

## Gathering Requirements in a plan driven project

It is important to write things down. Our use of language can hinder our thought process so its important to write things down.

### Outline of a Functional Specification

1. Overview: Executive summary of the product.
2. Disclaimer: Declare that the things are open to change.
3. Author's name: Generally either the Developing Manager or the Project Manager, based on how the organization operates. 
4. Scenarios of typical usage: User stories; actual requirements of the program
5. Open Issues: Things that you don't know when you start writing the functional requirements.

### Design and New Feature Ideas

It is good to use two different set of notes:
1. Planning phase notes: Requirements to be implemented during the coding process.
2. Backlog: Requirements that come up during the coding process; to be considered for the next release.

### One More Thing

Don't Obsess. Don't worry.

## Gathering Requirements in an agile project

No functional specifications required with this model. 

### Three Cs

1. Card: User stories
2. Conversation: Substantive discussion about what the product owner really want from the story
3. Confirmation: Acceptance criteria

### INVEST in Stories

1. Independent: The user stories should be independent of each other.
2. Negotiable: Allow the developers some room for change; allows for better creativity withing the bounds of requirements.
3. Valuable: The story must have some value to the customer.
4. Estimable: Stories should be focused enough for the devs to be able to estimate them.
5. Small: Goes along the point of estimation. Shorter stories are easier to break down into individual tasks.
6. Testable: Story should be traceable.
