Description: This is a markdown file containing section summaries for the middle of chapter 4. This is from pages 43-46 including the testable section. There are no section numbers for each summary due to the fact that the last section number from previous work is unknown.

### Scenarios of Typical Usage ### (Pg.43)
These are the requirements of the project. You can show a programs typical usage to get customers because you can present several scenarios of typical usage as part of the specifications.

### Open Issues ###(Pg.43)
There will be a few unknown things during the write-up of the functional specification. Create an issue and leave it open as the project progresses. Each time the customer is met with, try to get the answers to these open issues.

### Design and New Feature Ideas ### (Pg. 43-44)
Project managers and developers create two different types of notes. These types of notes are technical notes containing design or coding ideas for developers. An example of these notes can consist of a backlog: A set of notes containing requirements that are to be implemented on the next release.

### One More Thing ### (pg.44)
Don's spend all of your'e time obsessing about making sure every functional specification is correct. Chances are the customer will add additional requirements anyway. Also functional specifications are only considered complete after ship and release, so once again don't obsess.

### Requirements Gathering in an Agile Project ### (pg.44)
There is no functional specification in an agile development project. This is because developers of an agile team recognize that requirements will change over the course of a project and embrace that.  There is no need to gather requirements because an agile development team contains the customer as part of the team. That way there is room for immediate feedback, and timely updates on requirements.

### The Three C's ### (pg.44)
A user story has 3 fundamental components: the card, the conversation, and the confirmation.

### Card ### (pg.45)
A piece of paper, index card etc. Any physical thing in which the user story is written on. This acts as an invitation to a collaborative conversation about what the story really is and wants.

### Conversation ### (pg.45)
Takes place between important stakeholders in the projecct. This conversation essentially covers material that the owner really wants to see in the story. This can include revisions to the story, time estimates, and more details about the story.

### Confirmation ### (pg.45)
The last component of the user story. The product owner provides this as the final form of acceptance criteria for the story. Typically very simple and written on the back of the card as bullet points.

### INVEST in Stories ### (pg.45)
The previous 3 components of a user story tell us about the system. The acronym INVEST refers to the quality of the story.
### Independent ### (pg.45)
Each user story should be independent of each other. That way a single user story can be scheduled and implemented separately from any other user story. This can be important based on which agile process a team is using.

### Negotiable ### (pg.46)
A good story has room for negotiation amoung the parties involved. This should leave the developer and owner room to create an unique and workable implementation.

### Valuable ### (pg.46)
A good user story must have some kind of value to the customer. It must describe a feature or service that will be implemented in the product before the iteration is complete. Also, if a teams user story is too long, they should separate them into two smaller stories to be implemented in two different iterations.

### Estimable ### (pg.46)
Estimation is apart of the negotiation on the conversation. User stories must be able to be estimated becuase the product owner needs to be able to assign a relative priority to the story. Stories should not be too long, if so they might be subject to story splitting for a future iteration.

### Small ### (pg.46)
As stated a few times above, good user stories should be relatively small. This also helps increase the accuracy of the user story estimation. Rule of thumb: Should take no more than eight man-hours of work to complete.

### Testable ### (pg.46)
User stories must be testable. This relates back to the idea of traceablility where you should be able to trace a feature back through previous iterations designs, and requirements. This will confirm if the user story is correctly implemented

# Advantages of Typical Usage #
- Customer is more likely to read scenario if they are presented as user stories.
- Customers are more likely to understand your knowledge of the requirements. This is always a good thing because if you miss a feature or have an idea wrong, they can correct it. This is also best early on in the design process as the more communication with the customer at this time will more than likely lead to a product they actually will want and use.
