## Project Management Essentials

Understanding project management is required. Tasks involved:
* Project planning
* Estimation and scheduling
* Resource management
* Project oversight
* Project reviews and presentations
* The project retrospective

Project managngers are responsible for
- managing scope, costs, estiamtion, schedule, quality, personnel, communication, risk, etc.

The team manage the Agile project. They need to make to sure there is no delay in management decision-making. If there is a manager,
 - make sure the team has the resources
 - ensure the team adheres to aglie values and principles
 - facilitate communication
 - shield the team from outside interruptions

### Project Planning

For a plan-driven process model, a project plan is an actual document of how the project will be managed, written by the project manager.

A project plan has seven parts:
* Introdution and explanation of the project
* Team organization
* Risk analysis
* Hardware, software, and human resource requirements
* Task list and size and effort estiamtes
* Project schedule
* Project monitoring and reporting mechanisms

An agile project is feature-based, mulitlayer and organized into iterations. The project is owned by the team.

### Project Organization

Three things for project organization are:
1. How you are going to organize the team
2. Deciding the process model
3. Managing the project on day-to-day basis

These are important for brand new projects and inexperienced teams becuase it will help you to start the actual project work.

Since Agile team is small, it is easy to organize the proejct. The code, testings and expertise are all shared within the team. Being in an agile team will improve a lot of skills learning new things doing agile projects.

Agile projects are iterative, use short development cycles, and produce running code with more features at the end of each iteration. The team has daily meetings, integrations and shared or paired programming.

### Risk Analysis

We need to think of possiblie factors that can go wrong and how we are going to prevent from happening.
 - Schedule slips : A task could take longer than we expected. When it happens, we need to report immediately the estimated late time.
	It could happen often when there is not regular status meetings like plan-driven project.
 - Defet rate is excessive : If the program has a lot of bugs in tests, we should pause writing codes and look at the code a little bit and clean up the bug.
 - Requirements misunderstood : Regular meetings and frequent releases will help the misunderstanding between customers and developers.
 - Requirement churn : To release an update, it requires adding new features and fixing bugs.Churn happens when the customer continues to change requirements while development is underway.
 - Turnover : Best way to reduce turnover is to 1) give developers interesting work 2) have them work in pleasant enviroment 3) give them control over their own schedules.

All the risks are needed to address and find a way to avoid the risk. We can remove some feature from a release, stop work on new features and do a bug hunt, negotiate new features into a furture release, which is called mitigation. Then, we should have a plan to handle identifiable risks.
