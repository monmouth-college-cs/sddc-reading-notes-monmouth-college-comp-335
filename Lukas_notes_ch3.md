# Chapter 3 summary and notes

### Resource Requirements
(pg 33)

Resource Requirements are a simple part of management where you identify the whats, whens and wheres of the resources of the project. It includes Workstations, people, software, hardware and more.

## Task Estimates
(pg 33)

The first steps towards a schedule is seeing what you’ll be doing and figuring out how long each step will take. Task estimates are just that, estimates. It is impossible to know exactly how long a specific task will take and how accurate the developers prediction is largely based off of experience. The bigger the task the harder it is to know so it is better to breat down tasks that are estimated to take about a week or shorter. Then you can add them together and start doing larger estimates. "The estimation mantra is: size first, then effort and cost estimates, finally schedule."(pg 33) "Managers should never do development estimates. Even if a manager has been a developer in the past, unless they’re deeply involved in the actual development work, they shouldn’t be in the business of doing development estimates."(pg 34)

### Project Schedule
(pg 34-35)

Once you have the task estimates you can create a schedule. Important things to think about when making a cycle include the dependencies between tasks, your duty cycle, inclusion of sickdays and vacations, as well as the inability to schedule a developer to work on two tasks at once. It is also usedful to use project-scheduling software to make the schedule. It allows for greater organisation, especially for larger projects. Spolsky's Painless Schedule (pg 35) lists the following that should be in every schedule:
* Feature name
* Tasks within the feature
* The Priority of the task
* The Origional Estimate (in person hours)
* The Current Estimate (in person-hours)
* The Elapsed Time worked on the task (in person-hours)
* The Remaining Time on the task (also in person-hours)

## Velocity
(pg 35)

The Velocity of a task can also prove useful when creating a schedule. The velocity is defined as the estimated effort of a task, divided by the actual effort.  If you overestimate your task, your velocity will be greater than one (your task took less time than you originally thought); if you underestimate, it will be less than one (the task took you longer than you originally thought). Ideally, velocity should be 1.0, but that hardly ever happens. Velocity can be used to give both the manager and the developers an idea of how accurate their predictions are.
