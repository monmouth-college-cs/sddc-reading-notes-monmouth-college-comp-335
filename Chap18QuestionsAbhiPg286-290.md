# Deontological Theories (pg: 286, contd. section from pg: 284-85)

- Question: How does one determine whether a moral rule is correct or good?
Answer: A moral rule can be tested using the principle of universality. The book takes the example of promises to demonstrate the use of this principle. The moral being tested here is *I am allowed to make promises with the intention of breaking them later*. Applying this rule universally, we reach the conclusion that the word *promise* stops having a meaning if one can just break it at will based on their circumstances. Hence, the rule does not stand the universality principle. 

- Reference (Pg: 286): This page contains the pros and cons of the deontological ethics; can be useful in the future when making ethical decisions.

# Consequentialism (Teleological Theories, pg: 287)

- Question: What are the downsides of *act utilitarianism*?
Answer: This type of utilitarianism leads us down a path of complex calculations based on the ethical components of the action being evaluated. It also hinges heavily on *moral luck*.

- Question: How is *act utilitarianism* different than *rule utilitarianism*?
Answer: Act utilitarianism is the theory that says that an action is good if its net effect produces more happiness than unhappiness. Rule utilitarianism uses the same principle and only applies it to ethical rules instead of individual actions.
