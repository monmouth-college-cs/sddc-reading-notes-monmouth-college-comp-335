### Summary Of Summaries (Chapter 4)

Requirements of a system are a list of features of what a program is created to do. Another name for requirements are functional requirements. Functional requirements are used to gather requirements for plan driven models that a team may use. Creating a good usage story along with having good functional requirements for the system can help prevent schedule slippage and helps organize functional requirements for each iteration of the project. The INVEST model goes about the process of creating a overall useful usage story. The invest model goes as shown:
* I - Independent - Each usage story should be
  independent of one another. If all requirements are necesary to the customer, stories can be split into multiple iterations if necesary.
* N - Negotiable - Should be open to negotiations
  amoungst the parties involved.
* V - Valuable - Usage story needs to have some sort
  of value to the customer.
* E - Estimable - Stories need to estimable so the
  owner can assign the proper priority to them.
* S - Small - Stories should be short enough to
  be completed in one iteration. If they cant, they need to be split into several iterations.
* T - Testable
